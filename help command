You need a role named "ammo" to use. Can only be used in a server not in the bot's DM's
`+Send (@user)` - Sends that user the help command/bot info
`+Senda (@user)` - Sends the ammo chart to the user you ping

**Admin commands**
```
+Role (@user) - Adds the "ammo" role to a user & let's that user use "+send" & "+senda"
+Setup - Adds the ammo role to the server (role is only there so "+send" & "+senda" the bot will say who used it so it can be reported and all u have to do is take the ammo role from that user.

+SetupInfo - Tells you about why setup is there and how to use "+Send & +Senda" without giving the bot Permissions to "manage roles"
